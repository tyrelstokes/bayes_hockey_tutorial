# Bayes Hockey Tutorial
This tutorial is about understanding some of the practical details of setting priors and thinking about useful generated quantities with a stan model.

The examples are all relatively simple sports models. Much of the code is written to be pedagogical, matching the stan code more closely to the written probabilistic model.

At the end of the .rmd file you will find slightly more optimized versions of those models that may more useful to build off of if that is you intention.
